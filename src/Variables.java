public class Variables {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Case Sensitivity: Java is case-sensitive,which means that variable and Variable and VARIABLE are
        // considered different identifiers

        // Starting character: A  variable  name can begin with a letter (a to z or A to Z
        // or a dollar sign($). It cannot same with  a digit.

        // Subsequent Characters: After the first character,variable name can contain any combination of letters,
        // digits (0 to 9), underscores(_) or dollar signs($).

        // No Reserved Keywords: variable name cannot use java reserved keywords (like int, class, static etc.).
        // These keywords have special meaning in java and are not allowed for variable names.

        // Length: There is no limit to the length of a variable name, but its best to keep it reasonable
        // for readability purposes.

        // Conventions: While not enforced by java, following naming conventions improves code readability.
        // Typically variable name start with a lowercase letter and use camelCase for compound names
        // (e.g., myVariable, studentCount). For constants, use uppercase letters with underscores(e.g., MAX_HEIGHT).
        int age = 23;
